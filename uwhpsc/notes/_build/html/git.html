<span id="classgit"></span><h2>Instructions for cloning the class repository<a class="headerlink" href="#instructions-for-cloning-the-class-repository" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All of the materials for this class, including homeworks, sample programs,
and the webpages you are now
reading (or at least the <em>.rst</em> files used to create them, see
<a class="reference internal" href="sphinx.html#sphinx"><em>Sphinx documentation</em></a>), are in a Git repository hosted at Bitbucket, located
at
<a class="reference external" href="http://bitbucket.org/rjleveque/uwhpsc/">http://bitbucket.org/rjleveque/uwhpsc/</a>.
In addition to viewing the files via the link above, you can also view
changesets, issues, etc. (see <a class="reference internal" href="bitbucket.html#bitbucket"><em>Bitbucket repositories: viewing changesets, issue tracking</em></a>).</p>
<p>To obtain a copy, simply move to the directory where you want your copy to
reside (assumed to be your home directory below)
and then <em>clone</em> the repository:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ cd
$ git clone https://rjleveque@bitbucket.org/rjleveque/uwhpsc.git</pre>
</div>
<p>Note the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>It is assumed you have <em>git</em> installed, see
<a class="reference internal" href="software_installation.html#software-installation"><em>Downloading and installing software for this class</em></a>.</li>
<li>The clone statement will download the entire repository as a new
subdirectory called <em>uwhpsc</em>, residing in your home directory.  If you
want <em>uwhpsc</em> to reside elsewhere, you should first <em>cd</em> to that
directory.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>It will be useful to set a Unix environment variable (see <a class="reference internal" href="unix.html#env"><em>Environment variables</em></a>) called
<em>UWHPSC</em> to refer to the directory you have just created.  Assuming you are
using the bash shell (see <a class="reference internal" href="unix.html#bash"><em>The bash shell</em></a>), and that you cloned uwhpsc
into your home directory, you can do this via:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ export UWHPSC=$HOME/uwhpsc</pre>
</div>
<p>This uses the standard environment variable <em>HOME</em>, which is the full path
to your home directory.</p>
<p>If you put it somewhere else, you can instead do:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ cd uwhpsc
$ export UWHPSC=`pwd`</pre>
</div>
<p>The syntax
<em>`pwd`</em> means to run the <em>pwd</em> command (print working directory) and insert the
output of this command into the export command.</p>
<p>Type:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ printenv UWHPSC</pre>
</div>
<p>to make sure <em>UWHPSC</em> is set properly. This should print the full path to the
new directory.</p>
<p>If you log out and log in again later, you will find that this environment
variable is no longer set.  Or if you set it in one terminal window, it
will not be set in others.  To have it set automatically every time a new
bash shell is created (e.g. whenever a new terminal window is opened), add a
line of the form:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>export UWHPSC=$HOME/uwhpsc</pre>
</div>
<p>to your <em>.bashrc</em> file.  (See <a class="reference internal" href="unix.html#bashrc"><em>.bashrc file</em></a>).  This assumes it is in your
home directory.  If not, you will have to add a line of the form:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>export UWHPSC=full-path-to-uwhpsc</pre>
</div>
<p>where the full path is what was returned by the <em>printenv</em> statement above.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="updating-your-clone">
<span id="uwhpsc-update"></span><h2>Updating your clone<a class="headerlink" href="#updating-your-clone" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The files in the class repository will change as the quarter progresses &#8212;
new notes, sample programs, and homeworks will be added.  In order
to bring these changes over to your cloned copy, all you need to do is:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ cd $UWHPSC
$ git fetch origin
$ git merge origin/master</pre>
</div>
<p>Of course this assumes that <em>UWHPSC</em> has been properly set, see above.</p>
<p>The <em>git fetch</em> command instructs <em>git</em> to fetch any changes from <em>origin</em>,
which points to the remote bitbucket repository that you originally cloned
from.  In the merge command, <cite>origin/master</cite> refers to the master branch
in this repository (which
is the only branch that exists for this particular repository).
This merges any changes retrieved into the files in your current working
directory.</p>
<p>The last two command can be combined as:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git pull origin master</pre>
</div>
<p>or simply:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git pull</pre>
</div>
<p>since <cite>origin</cite> and <cite>master</cite> are the defaults.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-your-own-bitbucket-repository">
<span id="mygit"></span><h2>Creating your own Bitbucket repository<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-your-own-bitbucket-repository" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In addition to using the class repository, students in AMath 483/583 are
also required to create their own repository on Bitbucket.  It is possible
to use <em>git</em> for your own work without creating a repository on a hosted
site such as Bitbucket (see <em class="xref std std-ref">newgit</em> below), but there are several
reasons for this requirement:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>You should learn how to use Bitbucket for more than just pulling changes.</li>
<li>You will use this repository to &#8220;submit&#8221; your solutions to homeworks.
You will give the instructor and TA permission to clone your repository so
that we can grade the homework (others will not be able to clone or view it
unless you also give them permission).</li>
<li>It is recommended that after the class ends you
continue to use your repository as a way to back up your important work on
another computer (with all the benefits of version control too!).
At that point, of course, you can change the permissions so the
instructor and TA no longer have access.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Below are the instructions for creating your own repository.  Note that
this should be a <em>private repository</em> so nobody can view or clone it unless
you grant permission.</p>
<p>Anyone can create a free private repository on Bitbucket.
Note that you can also create an unlimited number of public repositories
free at Bitbucket, which you might want to do for open source software
projects, or for classes like this one.</p>
<p>Follow these directions exactly.  Doing so is part of <a class="reference internal" href="homework1.html#homework1"><em>Homework 1</em></a>.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">On the machine you&#8217;re working on:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email you@example.com</pre>
</div>
<p>These will be used when you commit changes.
If you don&#8217;t do this, you might get a warning message
the first time you try to commit.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Go to <a class="reference external" href="http://bitbucket.org/">http://bitbucket.org/</a> and click on &#8220;Sign up now&#8221; if you don&#8217;t
already have an account.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Fill in the form, make sure you remember your username and password.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You should then be taken to your account.  Click on &#8220;Create&#8221; next
to &#8220;Repositories&#8221;.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You should now see a form where you can specify the name of a repository
and a description.  The repository name need not be the same as your user
name (a single user might have several repositories).  For example, the class
repository is named <em>uwhpsc</em>, owned by user <em>rjleveque</em>.
To avoid confusion, you should probably not name your repository
<em>uwhpsc</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Make sure you click on &#8220;Private&#8221; at the bottom.  Also turn &#8220;Issue
tracking&#8221; and &#8220;Wiki&#8221; on if you wish to use these features.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Click on &#8220;Create repository&#8221;.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You should now see a page with instructions on how to <em>clone</em> your
(currently empty) repository.  In a Unix window, <em>cd</em> to the directory where
you want your cloned copy to reside, and perform the clone by typing in
the clone command shown.  This will create a new directory with the same
name as the repository.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You should now be able to <em>cd</em> into the directory this created.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">To keep track of where this directory is and get to it easily in the
future, create an environment variable <em>MYHPSC</em> from inside this directory
by:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ export MYHPSC=`pwd`</pre>
</div>
<p>See the discussion above in section <a class="reference internal" href="#classgit"><em>Instructions for cloning the class repository</em></a> for what this does.  You
will also probably want to add a line to your <em>.bashrc</em> file to define
<em>MYHPSC</em> similar to the line added for <em>UWHPSC</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The directory you are now in will appear empty if you simply do:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ ls</pre>
</div>
<p>But try:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ ls -a
./  ../  .git/</pre>
</div>
<p>the <em>-a</em> option causes <em>ls</em> to list files starting with a dot, which are
normally suppressed.  See <em class="xref std std-ref">ls</em> for a discussion of <em>./</em> and <em>../</em>.
The directory <em>.git</em> is the directory that stores all the information
about the contents of this directory and a complete history of every file
and every change ever committed.  You shouldn&#8217;t touch or modify the files in
this directory, they are used by <em>git</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Add a new file to your directory:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ cat &gt; testfile.txt
This is a new file
with only two lines so far.
^D</pre>
</div>
<p>The Unix <em>cat</em> command simply redirects everything you type on the
following lines into a file called <em>testfile.txt</em>.  This goes on until
you type a &lt;ctrl&gt;-d (the 4th line in the example
above).  After typing &lt;ctrl&gt;-d you should get the Unix
prompt back.  Alternatively, you could create the file testfile.txt using
your favorite text editor (see <a class="reference internal" href="editors.html#editors"><em>Text editors</em></a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Type:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git status -s</pre>
</div>
<p>The response should be:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>?? testfile.txt</pre>
</div>
<p>The ?? means that this file is not under revision control.
The <em>-s</em> flag results in this <em>short</em> status list.  Leave it off for more
information.</p>
<p>To put the file under revision control, type:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git add testfile.txt
$ git status -s
A  testfile.txt</pre>
</div>
<p>The A means it has been added.  However, at this point <em>git</em> is not
we have not yet taken a <em>snapshot</em> of this version of the file.
To do so, type:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git commit -m "My first commit of a test file."</pre>
</div>
<p>The string following the -m is a comment about this commit that may help
you in general remember why you committed new or changed files.</p>
<p>You should get a response like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>[master (root-commit) 28a4da5] My first commit of a test file.
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 testfile.txt</pre>
</div>
<p>We can now see the status of our directory via:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)</pre>
</div>
<p>Alternatively, you can check the status of a single file with:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git status testfile.txt</pre>
</div>
<p>You can get a list of all the commits you have made (only one so far)
using:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git log

commit 28a4da5a0deb04b32a0f2fd08f78e43d6bd9e9dd
Author: Randy LeVeque &lt;rjl@ned&gt;
Date:   Tue Mar 5 17:44:22 2013 -0800

    My first commit of a test file.</pre>
</div>
<p>The number 28a4da5a0deb04b32a0f2fd08f78e43d6bd9e9dd above is the &#8220;name&#8221;
of this commit and you can always get back to the state of your files as
of this commit by using this number.  You don&#8217;t have to remember it, you
can use commands like <em>git log</em> to find it later.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a number... it is a 40 digit hexadecimal number, meaning it
is in base 16 so in addition to 0, 1, 2, ..., 9, there are 6 more digits
a, b, c, d, e, f representing 10 through 15.  This number is almost
certainly guaranteed to be unique among all commits you will ever
do (or anyone has ever done, for that matter).  It is computed based
on the state of all the files in this snapshot as a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA-1
Cryptographic hash function</a>,
called a SHA-1 Hash for short.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s modify this file:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ cat &gt;&gt; testfile.txt
Adding a third line
^D</pre>
</div>
<p>Here the <em>&gt;&gt;</em> tells <em>cat</em> that we want to add on to the end of an
existing file rather than creating a new one.  (Or you can edit the file
with your favorite editor and add this third line.)</p>
<p>Now try the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git status -s
 M testfile.txt</pre>
</div>
<p>The M indicates this file has been modified relative to the most recent
version that was committed.</p>
<p>To see what changes have been made, try:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git diff testfile.txt</pre>
</div>
<p>This will produce something like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>diff --git a/testfile.txt b/testfile.txt
index d80ef00..fe42584 100644
--- a/testfile.txt
+++ b/testfile.txt
@@ -1,2 +1,3 @@
 This is a new file
 with only two lines so far
+Adding a third line</pre>
</div>
<p>The + in front of the last line shows that it was added.
The two lines before it are printed to show the context.  If the
file were longer, <em>git diff</em>
would only print a few lines around any change to indicate the context.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s try to commit this changed file:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git commit -m "added a third line to the test file"</pre>
</div>
<p>This will fail!  You should get a response like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working
#   directory)
#
#   modified:   testfile.txt
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</pre>
</div>
<p><em>git</em> is saying that the file <em>testfile.txt</em> is modified but that no
files have been <strong>staged</strong> for this commit.</p>
<p>If you are used to Mercurial, <em>git</em> has an extra level of complexity (but
also flexibility):  you can choose which modified files will be included
in the next commit.  Since we only have one file, there will not be a
commit unless we add this to the <strong>index</strong> of files staged for the next
commit:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git add testfile.txt</pre>
</div>
<p>Note that the status is now:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git status -s
M  testfile.txt</pre>
</div>
<p>This is different in a subtle way from what we saw before: The <em>M</em> is
in the first column rather than the second, meaning it has been both
modified and staged.</p>
<p>We can get more information if we leave off the <em>-s</em> flag:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git status

# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#   modified:   testfile.txt
#</pre>
</div>
<p>Now <em>testfile.txt</em> is on the index of files staged for the next commit.</p>
<p>Now we can do the commit:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git commit -m "added a third line to the test file"

[master 51918d7] added a third line to the test file
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)</pre>
</div>
<p>Try doing <em>git log</em> now and you should see something like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>commit 51918d7ea4a63da6ab42b3c03f661cbc1a560815
Author: Randy LeVeque &lt;rjl@ned&gt;
Date:   Tue Mar 5 18:11:34 2013 -0800

    added a third line to the test file

commit 28a4da5a0deb04b32a0f2fd08f78e43d6bd9e9dd
Author: Randy LeVeque &lt;rjl@ned&gt;
Date:   Tue Mar 5 17:44:22 2013 -0800

    My first commit of a test file.</pre>
</div>
<p>If you want to revert your working directory back to the first snapshot
you could do:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git checkout 28a4da5a0de
Note: checking out '28a4da5a0de'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

HEAD is now at 28a4da5... My first commit of a test file.</pre>
</div>
<p>Take a look at the file, it should be back to the state with only two
lines.</p>
<p>Note that you don&#8217;t need the full SHA-1 hash code, the first few digits
are enough to uniquely identify it.</p>
<p>You can go back to the most recent version with:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'</pre>
</div>
<p>We won&#8217;t discuss branches, but unless you create a new branch, the
default name for your main branch is <em>master</em> and this <em>checkout</em> command
just goes back to the most recent commit.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">So far you have been using <em>git</em> to keep track of changes in your own
directory, on your computer.  None of these changes have been seen by
Bitbucket, so if someone else cloned your repository from there, they
would not see <em>testfile.txt</em>.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s <em>push</em> these changes back to the Bitbucket repository:</p>
<p>First do:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git status</pre>
</div>
<p>to make sure there are no changes that have not been committed.  This
should print nothing.</p>
<p>Now do:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git push -u origin master</pre>
</div>
<p>This will prompt for your Bitbucket password and should then print
something indicating that it has uploaded these two commits to
your bitbucket repository.</p>
<p>Not only has it copied the 1 file over, it has added both changesets, so
the entire history of your commits is now stored in the repository.  If
someone else clones the repository, they get the entire commit history
and could revert to any previous version, for example.</p>
<p>To push future commits to bitbucket, you should only need to do:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git push</pre>
</div>
<p>and by default it will push your master branch (the only branch you
have, probably) to <cite>origin</cite>, which is the shorthand name for the
place you originally cloned the repository from.  To see where this
actually points to:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git remote -v</pre>

<p>This lists all <cite>remotes</cite>.
By default there is only one, the place you cloned the repository from.
(Or none if you had created a new repository using <cite>git init</cite> rather
than cloning an existing one.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Check that the file is in your Bitbucket repository:  Go back to that web
page for your repository and click on the  &#8220;Source&#8221; tab at the top.  It
should display the files in your repository and show <em>testfile.txt</em>.</p>
<p>Now click on the &#8220;Commits&#8221; tab at the top.  It should show that you
made two commits and display the comments you added with the <em>-m</em> flag
with each commit.</p>
<p>If you click on the hex-string for a commit, it will show the
<em>change set</em> for this commit.  What you
should see is the file in its final state, with three lines.  The third
line should be highlighted in green, indicating that this line was added
in this changeset.  A line highlighted in red would indicate a line deleted
in this changeset.  (See also <a class="reference internal" href="bitbucket.html#bitbucket"><em>Bitbucket repositories: viewing changesets, issue tracking</em></a>.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is enough for now!</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="homework1.html#homework1"><em>Homework 1</em></a> instructs you to add some additional files to the Bitbucket
repository.</p>
<p>Feel free to experiment further with your repository at this point.</p>
